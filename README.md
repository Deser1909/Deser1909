**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Artist)`**

I'm a high school student learning how to become the best web developer, one step at a time, enjoying the process, building all the things that I can imagine, and making a lot of mistakes. Most of the time, I get frustrated, but in the end, I figure out how to build all of the things that my mind lets me do.
